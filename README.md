Mastering Python and PyMongo - Test Script

PyMongo is a Python library that provides a way to interact with MongoDB databases from Python code. 
It is a powerful and flexible library that allows you to perform a wide range of operations on MongoDB databases, such as querying data, inserting and updating documents, and more. 
PyMongo is easy to install and use, and it has good documentation and community support.

## Mongo Database and PyMongo Scripting

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is a popular database for web applications, and it is known for its scalability and flexibility. MongoDB stores data in collections, which are similar to tables in a relational database.

To work with MongoDB using PyMongo, you need to connect to a MongoDB database using the MongoClient class. Here is an example of how to connect to a MongoDB database:
```
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client.test_database
```

In this example, we are connecting to a MongoDB database on the local machine using the default port (27017). We are also creating a new database called "test_database".

Here is another example of how to use PyMongo to insert a document into a MongoDB collection:
```
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client.test_database
collection = db.test_collection

post = {"author": "John Smith", "text": "My first blog post!", "tags": ["mongodb", "python", "pymongo"]}
post_id = collection.insert_one(post).inserted_id
```

In this example, we are connecting to a MongoDB database using the MongoClient class, and we are creating a new document in a collection called "test_collection". 
We are also assigning the ID of the new document to a variable called "post_id".
